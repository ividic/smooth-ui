# Custom component

Sometimes you may want to use a component but the resulting HTML tag is not the good one. Or you want to use a `Button` with another component like [the `Link` from React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link).

You can do it using two approaches.

## Use "as" property

Every components accepts a `as` property, it defines the base component used in each component.

An example of an `Alert` that uses `span` as a component.

<Playground>
  <Alert as="span" variant="primary">
    A span alert
  </Alert>
</Playground>

## Use "withComponent"

Styled Components has a magic method called [`.withComponent`](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/api#withcomponent), it gives you the opportunity to keep style and swap the component. All Smooth UI components exposes the same method, this way you can easily create a new component from another without losing the style.

An example of `Button` that will use `a` instead of `button`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const LinkButton = Button.withComponent('a')
    return (
      <LinkButton href="#">
        A button as a link
      </LinkButton>
    )
  }}
</Playground>
